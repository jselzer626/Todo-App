Old school ticketing system:

-when you add a task in tab view it must get loaded when you click on block view

-add column class to each div if column display selected

-on tab display, perhaps add title line within the div

-buttons for each task to:
  -delete (trashcan icon?)
  -complete (checkbox)
  -push through to next stage(i.e. from not started to in progress, right arrow icon?)

-add dragability to each task
