Old school ticketing system:


Done:
-enable enter for key press of main task add input

-when you add a task in tab view it must get loaded when you click on block view

-add column class to each div if column display selected

-need to add divs for tab display that correspond to each bucket, its getting too confusing to do it separately

-buttons for each task to:
  -delete (trashcan icon?)
  -complete (checkbox)

-configure p's for drop event in tabbed view

-add dragability to each task

-background of li's turn gray on mouseover
